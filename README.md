# Analog-to-Digital-and-Digital-to-Analog-Converter
In Task 1, a complete 2-bit Analog-to-Digital (ADC) and Digital-to-Analog (DAC) conversion chain was designed, simulated, and tested on a breadboard. The system includes all major signal-processing stages required in a practical data-conversion pipeline.

🔧 System Overview

The AD/DA system was developed with the following major components:

4th-Order Butterworth Low-Pass Filters (LPF)
Used at both the input (anti-aliasing filter) and output (reconstruction filter) stages.
These unity-gain Butterworth filters ensure:

Flat passband response
No ripple
Smooth signal reconstruction

Effective reduction of high-frequency noise and aliasing

Sample-and-Hold Circuit
Captures and holds the analog input signal for stable conversion during each clock cycle.

Comparator-based 2-bit ADC
Implemented using LM358P op-amps and discrete comparators to generate 2-bit digital output levels.

Resistor-based DAC (R-2R Ladder / Weighted Resistor Network)
Converts the 2-bit digital signal back into an analog output.

Reconstruction Filter (4th-order Butterworth LPF)
Smoothens the DAC output and removes stair-step behavior.

📈 Adaptive Peak Detection

To improve system accuracy, an adaptive peak detection algorithm was implemented using op-amp rectifiers and peak-hold capacitive circuits.

This resulted in:

More stable digital level transitions

Reduced error in 2-bit quantization

Better reconstruction quality after the DAC stage

🧪 Verification & Testing

The full system was tested using:

Simulation (LTspice/Multisim/Proteus)
— Verified frequency response, sampling behavior, comparators, and DAC levels.

Breadboard Implementation
— Validated real-world signal flow
— Measured ADC thresholds and DAC output
— Ensured filter behavior matched design targets

📌 Outcome

Task 1 successfully demonstrated a fully functional 2-bit AD/DA conversion system with practical filtering, sampling, conversion, and signal reconstruction stages. The inclusion of adaptive peak detection and 4th-order Butterworth filters significantly improved overall performance and signal integrity.
